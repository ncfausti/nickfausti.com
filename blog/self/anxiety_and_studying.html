                <p>
                    Yesterday, after 15 weeks of intense study and focus,
                    I took my final exam for EAS545 - Engineering Entrepreneurship.
                    This course, taught by Dr. Thomas Cassel at Penn Engineering, was
                    one of my favorite courses I've ever taken. Professor Cassel does
                    such an incredible job of encouraging his students to
                    engage with the material, asking us to put ourselves in the shoes
                    of the people we are reading about in the case studies; to really
                    understand and analyze the situations in depth. I loved working through
                    this course and all of the material, and yet, today I am incredibly
                    dissatisfied with my results yesterday. I ended up getting a 79/80 on the
                    material related to the readings and general ideas of the class, and a 0/20
                    on the section related to venture capital finance/term sheets. I got a 79/100 on the final
                    exam, and this was 15% of my final grade. I will almost certainly not receive
                    a full 'A' that I had worked so hard for all semester. (edit: I ended up getting an ‘A-’.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some background, I'm currently pursuing an MSE in Computer and Information Science
                    at Penn. Last Summer, I returned home from travelling to take an accelerated course
                    on Artificial Intelligence as part of my degree. I was extremely interested in the material and
                    enjoyed
                    the class, yet I performed poorly, procrastinating and not dedicating enough time
                    to the assignments/exam. I got a 'C' and was placed on academic probation because that grade
                    brought my GPA below the threshold for being in good standing in the engineering school.
                    This was one of the lowest points for me in recent memory. This experience led me to
                    question (like I have done so many times before) what was going on with me personally.
                    I had left an incredible experience in (<a href="https://remoteyear.com" _target="blank">Remote
                        Year</a>)
                    early to take this course, and still, I could not bring myself to go through the
                    assignments diligently, instead allowing my anxiety to put things off and rush through them
                    at the last minute.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Along with this, I had been noticing that I would become irrationally irritated by people
                    in coffee shops and public spaces having what others would consider normal level
                    conversations. With noise-canceling headphones (and earbuds inside of those) I would still
                    fixate on the words of the conversations that were happening around me. This would
                    distract me from my work and studying, and it turned out that the only place where I
                    could be somewhat productive was in the deepest corners of the library, with no visual or
                    auditory stimuli. As you can imagine, constantly needing to be in complete silence was not
                    an adequate solution to my problem. There will certainly be times where I would need to be
                    able to focus and work effectively, I would not always be able to be on the 5th floor of
                    Van Pelt library. This, in combination with the generalized anxiety, procrastination, and
                    time-blindness that I have experienced for most of my life, led me to seek professional help.
                    I talked with my PCP and mentioned that all of my four siblings were diagnosed with ADHD when
                    they were younger, and he recommended that I go for neuro-psychological testing to see if I
                    had it as well. Fast-forward a couple of months, my testing resulted in a diagnosis of
                    ADHD-Inattentive subtype, and I started treatment for it.
                </p>

                    It was now January--the beginning of the Spring 2020 semester--equipped with a clear plan on how
                    to combat this awful disorder, I’m excited for the possibilities that lie ahead. My results have
                    been remarkable. I no longer procrastinate for assignments, I engage with the readings prior to
                    class and as a result I get so much more out of every lecture. I received a perfect score on my
                    Game Development mid-term and had been getting 9s and 10s on all of my bi-weekly 10-point
                    assignments
                    for Engineering Entrepreneurship. I have been going to office hours and making sure that I’m doing
                    what’s necessary to excel in my courses. There have been a couple of slip-ups throughout the
                    semester
                    where I would submit assignments late or wait until the last minute, but these were the exceptions
                    now,
                    not the norm. They would happen as a direct result of my anxiety getting the better of me. I knew
                    something was going to require more effort than usual, and I would “psyche myself out” and put it
                    on a pedestal of being more difficult, and as a result I would put it off as a way to avoid that
                    all too familiar feeling of discomfort.
                </p>

                    This is my mistake. <strong> TLDR; This is why I am writing this post. I
                        want to remind myself (and others) to be mindful about the thoughts and emotions we experience
                        while learning difficult subjects. This discomfort can be your guide. Ignore it and it will
                        steer
                        you unconsciously down a path of misery and despair. Embrace it, analyze and understand it, and
                        accept it for what it is, and it can be a powerful tool to inform you of the areas where you
                        need
                        to improve upon your understanding of something.</strong> While preparing for my final
                    exam in EAS 545, I had waited until the day before to study. Partly because I was working on
                    another project, partly because I was fairly confident in my understanding of the majority of
                    the material. Key word here being majority. I put off studying for the part that I knew needed more
                    attention because I was letting the discomforting feeling of not understanding neglect the exact
                    material
                    I needed to be paying the most attention to. I won't let this happen again.
